## SMS-Verification

SMS validation is a way to verify that is the user is requesting the user that we want? This program creates a very small automation to verify the users by using [Kavenegar](https://kavenegar.com/) web APIs. Simply add your users, it keeps them in a file and let them log in. Once they forget their password, the magic show goes up. They press the "Forget the password" link and the SMS-server will send a verification code to the registered phone number. You should write it up in order to be able to change your password and generate a new one.
